<h1> Cruise Ship Application <h1>
This is a simple cruise ship application that allows users to add the name of a port to a form/submit function, and then the cruise ship will move to the next port on its itinerary.

<h2> Getting Started <h2>
To use this application, you will need to have a modern web browser installed on your computer. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and does not require any additional dependencies or libraries.

To get started, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

<h2> Usage<h2>
The application consists of a simple form with a single input field. To add a new port to the ship's itinerary, simply enter the name of the port in the input field and click the "Submit" button. The ship will then move to the next port on its itinerary.

If you need to reset the itinerary and start over from the beginning, simply click the "Reset" button. This will clear the current itinerary and allow you to add new ports from the beginning.
